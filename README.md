# **What is LearnixOS?**
  - An easy to use Distro created and pre-configured with i3 and Cinnamon
  - GNU/Linux distro tailored towards beginners ü¶æ
      - Teaches the user how to use compiler based distros. Compiler features are optional and binary packages are the default.
  - GPL_3.0 License, we will stay open-source :fire: :fire: :fire:

# **Should I use it?**
  - This is really easy to use, videos online for tutorials on Learnix's Channel :flex:
