What is LearnixOS?
  - An easy to use Distro that was created to be pre-configured with i3 and cinnamon
  - GNU/Linux distro tailed for the beginners ü¶æ
  - GPL_3.0 License, we will stay open-source :fire: :fire: :fire:

Should I use it?
  - This is really easy to use, videos online for tutorials on Learnix's Channel :flex:
  - Why not? You watched LearnixTV, I would trust the OS made after him üêß
