What is LearnixOS?
  - An easy to use distro that was created to be pre-configured with i3
  - Linux Mint base for the beginners ü¶æ
  - It also relies on Linux Mint's packages/repos so this won't be undermaintanted
  - GPL_3.0 License, we will stay open-source :fire: :fire: :fire:

Should I use it?
  - Why not? You watched LearnixTV, I would trust the OS made after him üêß
  - Also for people who have crappy hardware, this should run better than Puppy Linux /j
